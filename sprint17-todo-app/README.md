# Todo App

Learn React by implementing a Todo App alongside your Frontend mentor as a part of **React** course from [SkillBrain©](https://skillbrain.com/)

Building a Todo App is easy and does not take much time but it teaches you some important concepts which are very important to understand for any developer.

**Check the docs below before procedeeng to your task.**

## Prerequisites

Since these are your first weeks with the React world, we would keep things simple. The starting code already includes the core components and styles - the building blocks you will need to implement this task.

> Make sure you understand the role of these components as you are going to use them in your implementation.

## Task Requirements

💡 The requirements of the task as well as a description of the project structure can be found in this [video](https://class.skillbrain.com/unit/view/id:3264) 👈🏻

> In software development, a user story is an actionable goal from the perspective of the user. Defining user stories before you begin your work will help you focus on work.

### ✅ The app should fulfill the following stories:

#### 1️⃣ View all todos in two separated list **active todos** and **completed todos** [ ⭐️ ]

- Use a `state` to store your todos. Initialize it from `TODOS_MOCK` array, found in `App.js` file. This array will help you to understand how your state should look like.
- Display the todos from your `state` with `<TodoItem />` component.

  - Initially, the information displayed by `<TodoItem />` component is static.
  - Make this component reusable and add the changes to receive the displayed data dynamically through `props`.
  - We added one `prop` for you - `completed`, which is responsible for styling the completed / active items. You don't have to worry about styling. Just make sure you pass the proper values.
  - Display todos in two separate lists, depending on completed value.
  - **HINT !** use array methods: `map()` and `filter()`.

    > By using the JavaScript method, map(), you will be able to create a new array of items by mapping over the todo items from state.

    > By using the JavaScript method, filter(), you will be able to filter your array before mapping.

#### 2️⃣ Add todos [⭐️]

- Add the functionality into a form.

  - update the form by setting the state.
  - Handle the submit and add the new item to the `todo` list.

- 2.1 [ ⭐️ ] Your form will be displayed inside of modal component. You can import this component from `src/components/modal/Modal.jsx`
  - Clicking on `ADD + ` button will open the modal.
    > Don't forget to add a state to control your modal (open / close)

#### 3️⃣ Mark todo as complete / done [ ⭐️ ⭐️ ]

- By checking / unchecking the checkbox, todo item will update it's status and move to another list.

#### 4️⃣ Delete any task [⭐️]

- Clicking on delete icon will remove the coresponding item.

#### 5️⃣ Editing any task [⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️]

- Clicking on edit icon will open the modal and prefill the form fields with corespending data.
- User will be able to edit these fields and submit the form.
- Todo Item will be updated.
